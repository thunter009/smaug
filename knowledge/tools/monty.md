## Overview
Monty is a new Python implementation built from scratch in Rust, designed specifically for LLMs to run code without host access. It provides a secure sandbox environment for executing untrusted Python code.

## Key Features
- **Ultra-fast startup:** Single-digit microsecond startup times (not seconds)
- **Secure:** Designed for running untrusted code from AI agents safely
- **Python-compatible:** Full Python implementation from scratch in Rust
- **AI-focused:** Purpose-built for LLM code execution scenarios

## Use Cases
- LLM code execution sandboxing
- Safe evaluation of untrusted Python code
- AI agent tooling requiring rapid startup times
